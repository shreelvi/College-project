        Amazon AWS
        Amazon AWS provides the wide range of service from domain hosting to the Cloud computing service. This is easy to use with the features that allow you to customize according to the need of the user. It is fully scalable from small business to the enterprise level. This is cost-effective as the customer can get the different service depending upon the budget and the necessity of the organization. This is the trusted and reliable platform for the business looking to grow over time which is backed by a multi-billion dollar company Amazon.com. I will be using Amazon AWS as the requirement for this class. This also provides free limited service to the student. It is easy to learn and can be configured as the need of the user.
        Go Daddy
        Go Daddy is the hottest site to host domain for the user looking into the economic budget. It provides the wide range of services from economy, deluxe and ultimate packages. The user can choose the package according to the need. According to paulagabin, “It is 70% cheaper than its competitors, with new domain registration going for less than $13 and standard SSL certificates at $13 for single domains and $89.99 for multiple domains (up to five).” Secures the user by locking the domain name purchased through them to protect the user credentials. It provides the easy website creation tool like Wix which gives privilege to the new user who can barely code.
        Google Domain
        Google Cloud Service is the most preferred platform among the IT managers in comparison to its competitors like Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS. It provides the Services like Pay-as-Use you are not forced to pay for the service that you never used. Google has their own network which makes powerful while comparing to the rest of its competitors. According to Kinsta.com, “The other thing – it has a privately distributed backbone between all the data centers.” It offers the live migration of the virtual machine which most of the provider does not offer. Security is most important for any web-based service so Google takes it as a serious and important concern. All the data are encrypted in transit between user, server, and data center.
        Wix
        Wix is the templet base website hosting site. The user does not have to be a computer literate to design or host the site. However, it is limited to the purpose and the availability of the system. The main purpose of the Wix is to help the customer with zero coding skill. Customization of the site is almost impossible as you must follow the templet. It is mostly used by photographer, Restaurant and other small business. It is cost-efficient and easy to use so it is famous between the user outside the field of Information Technology.
        Weebly
        Weebly is mostly used by blogger and the online services as it supports services like PayPal and Strip. It is customizable, and it delivers more features then Wix which is the close competitors in the market. It delivers the service uptime of 99.97%. It has the code editing features which allows the user to edit the templet as the need and with personal customization.
